## 11/6/2025 - Started the schematic  

I was looking through some reddit posts and found that someone had a cool looking PCB ruler and I decided to make my own (to take a break from other thought intensive projects) and yea...

I started by researching the most common footprints and packages to include in the PCB and also a list of stuff that I plan on adding:

- AWG Guage / Via hole size
- Trace Thickness
- Ruler with in/mm (duh)
- Protractor
- Silkscreen with MOSFET channel types
- Silkscreen with formulas
- Silkscreen with Smith Chart :skull:
