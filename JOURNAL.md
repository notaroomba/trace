## 11/6/2025 7 AM - Started the schematic  

I was looking through some reddit posts and found that someone had a cool looking PCB ruler and I decided to make my own (to take a break from other thought intensive projects) and yea...

I started by researching the most common footprints and packages to include in the PCB and also a list of stuff that I plan on adding:

- AWG Guage / Via hole size
- Trace Thickness
- Ruler with in/mm (duh)
- Protractor
- Silkscreen with MOSFET channel types
- Silkscreen with formulas
- Silkscreen with Smith Chart :skull:

## 11/6/2025 10 AM - PCB layout

I then started working on the layout of the PCB, I wanted it to be 250mmx25mm originally but later changed it to 310x35mm.

I also researched some more and added more components in different footprints.

and after organizing it a bit I'm working on making the protractor

## 11/7/2025 - Started adding silkscreen  

I started working on finishing the protractor

but then I got distracted and wanted to finish the metric side

Had to go into figma and manually add the 10* and 5* angles

Worked on it a buit more and am starting to organize the components together:

## 11/8/2025 - Organizing Components  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTE3MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fd21505cdd1ee834d765af35d22044e71c0a7035/image.png)

I want this to be kinda compact so I'm trying to organize the components as neatly as possible lol.

Finally finished up the capacitor section and went back and added more resistors:

I then finished the front side by adding inductors and diodes/general components:

I still have to add in the IC's on the back
